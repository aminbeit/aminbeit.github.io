  I want to learn CIT professionally, as I have not free time during days then the best way is CIT part time.
<br>

Actually I have a soccer website since 2001 and I update it evereyday. During that time I worked with some developers and programmers. I think it's better to learn and do it myself.
this is one of the reason that I'm here :)
